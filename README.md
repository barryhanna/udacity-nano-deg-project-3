## Frontend Nano Degree Arcade Game

A clone of a classic arcade game.

## How to play

The goal of the game is to reach the top of the screen and avoid colliding with the ladybirds. The more times you reach the water, the more ladybirds that will try to obstruct your path. 

To gain points you must collect items that will appear on the screen (Gems). There is also a special item, the DeathRock, which allows you to remove some of the ladybirds in your path, be sure to grab it!

You will begin with 3 lives but will have the opportunity to gain more.

I also used code from this article [Modals](https://lowrey.me/modals-in-pure-es6-javascript/) to make the modal character selection screen.
